<p align="center">Circles is an open source, decentralized social network where people can move within a physical space and interact with each other.</p>
<p align="center">Every User's Account lives within a Server. These Users can create Circles within these Servers, and sub Circles within those. Any other User can move in and out of Public Circles. Users can send messages in the Circle they're in, or in the entire Server. Users can also create Conversations with specific Users.</p>

# Why
I created Circles for a few reasons: 
- I care a lot about open source and I feel that we need more options for FOSS social media
- Right now, people on social media just feel like users who post stuff. I want Circles to feel like an actual space where people can move and interact, and allow people to have their own ways of expressing themselves.

I have lots of ideas on how to make Circles great and It's going to be a lot of work, but I'm very excited.

# Hacktoberfest
Circles is proud to be a part of hacktoberfest 2023! I'd love to see some people contributing to Circles, and I'll also be contributing to other open source projects during Hacktoberfest.

If you're not sure what Hacktoberfest is, It's an celebration of open source software. It teaches users the power of open source, how to use source control and how to contribute to open source projects. The internet is powered by open source, and contibuting and celebrating that and the people behind it is what Hacktoberfest is all about.

Circles is a very new project, and there's lots of things to be done. If you have any skills to help get some of the things on the above list finished, or just want to help clean up some code, I'd appreciate it.
